Particle simulation in terminal for win

First:
  setup a desired resolution (height and width) in .cpp file. Remember, that Y is ~doubled in terminal
  set ur terminal (font size and window size) to height and width u wrote in .cpp
  something too small probably won't work very well because text need some space, so I go
    int width = 600;
    int height = 220; 
    and same in the terminal with 2pt font size (Courier New for me)
Second:
  if u figured out first step now probably circles might be elliptical on some resolutions/fonts, i'll add modifier constant later
  u can use WASD + QE keys to move 
  RF, TG, 12, ZX, H and C keys to change coeffs
  u can change srand(coeff) coeff to change seed and gCount to change galaxies amount. I'll ad a big head with settings later and probably a settings menu.
  
If u done all the steps correctly u'll have something like this, ENJOY!:
